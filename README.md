# ScriptLab

> ⚠️ This is a personal testing ground for untested, incomplete, or theoretical scripts. Use with caution.

This repository is meant for trying out new script ideas, proof-of-concepts, or commands that may eventually move into more stable toolkits once tested and validated.

---

## Current Experiments

- *(Will be adding soon!)*

---

## Usage
All scripts are provided **as-is** and may not work as expected.
Use in a test lab, VM, or safe environment before trying anywhere important.

```powershell
.\ScriptName.ps1
```

---

## Notes
These scripts are not supported or production-ready.
Once tested and working, scripts may be promoted to another repository

## License
MIT — feel free to fork or build on any ideas here, but use at your own risk.
